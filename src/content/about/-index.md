I proudly say, I am a Best DevOps Engineer in the Nepal. I have worked hard to build my knowledge and expertise in the field of DevOps working from companies like Nepallink, Fusemachines, Cloudhero (Romania). I am fortunate enough to work and help big corporate like Veolia , WayDev, MoovsDigital from around the world.

As, I come from Developers background shifting my career path to DevOps was a big risk and challenge for me but with my great zeal for it, willingness to learn DevOps and commitment for last 8years made me succeed. Still a long way to go. I am here to share my insights and experiences to help companies succeed.
