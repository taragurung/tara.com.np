## **Project Overview:**

Before COVID-19 struck, I was living and working in Kathmandu, where vibrant tech communities thrived. I actively participated in many of them, gaining insights and building connections. However, when the pandemic hit, I returned to my hometown, Pokhara, only to discover a lack of active tech communities here.

Determined to change that, I connected on LinkedIn with someone(Surendra Tamang) equally passionate about building a tech ecosystem in Pokhara. Together, we decided to take the plunge. It’s been over a year and a half since we started, and we’ve stayed consistent, organizing monthly meetups. These gatherings provide a platform for individuals to share their experiences and technical expertise while fostering networking opportunities. It's incredible to see how far we've come in cultivating a growing and dynamic tech community in Pokhara.
## Objectives

1. Start a tech community in Pokhara which was missing.
2. Make it a platform for everyone to learn share and grow together.
3. Make it a network platform for tech enthusiast.

## Event updates:
- so fare conudcated 17th meetups
- Started with 2 people now we have 7 dedicated people in the team to volunteer and make the event happen evey month.
