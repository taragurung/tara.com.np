## Tara Gurung	- Software Engineer who loves to call himself DevOps 
I graduated in 2012 and started exploring the tech world, got inspired by the affect and values that DevOps brings to a software company and its development process, since then I am working as DevOps engineer and gradually practicing SRE as well for past 7years.
