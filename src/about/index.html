<h2>Tara Prasad Gurung</h2>

<p>"Hi there, I'm Tara Prasad Gurung, a DevOps Engineer with 7 years of experience in the field. I hold an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering and began my career as a Python Developer. However, my passion for DevOps eventually led me to switch roles and focus on helping organizations deliver software more efficiently and reliably. In my free time, I'm actively involved in the Developer Community Pokhara chapter, both as a participant and a host. It's a great way to connect with like-minded professionals, learn new skills, and contribute to the tech community. I have expertise in a wide range of DevOps tools and practices, including automation, CI/CD, containerization, and infrastructure as code. When I'm not coding or networking, you can find me hiking in the beautiful mountains of Nepal. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and collaborate with others who share my passion for technology and innovation."</p>
